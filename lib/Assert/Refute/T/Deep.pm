=head1 NAME

Assert::Refute::T::Deep - Test::Deep plugin for Assert::Refute

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Assert::Refute> for what a C<try_refute> block is for.
In a nutshell, it's a set of L<Test::More>-like assertions
that appends its results to a "report" object
rather than standard output.

This module allows to use L<Test::Deep> with L<Assert::Refute>

    use Assert::Refute;
    use Assert::Refute::T::Deep;

    my $report = try_refute {
        cmp_deeply $my_data, $spec, "Data is as expected";
    };

    if (!$report->is_passing) {
        warn $report->get_tap;
    };


=head1 EXPORT

=cut

use parent qw(Exporter);
use Assert::Refute::Build;
use Test::Deep qw(:all);

# Blindly reexport whatever Test::Deep has
our @EXPORT      = @Test::Deep::EXPORT;
our @EXPORT_OK   = @Test::Deep::EXPORT_OK;
our %EXPORT_TAGS = %Test::Deep::EXPORT_TAGS;

=head2 cmp_deeply

=cut

# Remove the implementation imported from Test::Deep
undef *cmp_deeply;

build_refute cmp_deeply => sub {
    my ($ok, $stack) = cmp_details( @_ );
    return !$ok && deep_diag($stack);
}, args => 2, export => 1;
